# Instructions:
 
## 1. Open your unix terminal and run the command  
`git clone https://github.com/cssallg001/CS463-Course-Project.git`
- This will cause the repository to be cloned to the current directory of your local machine. 

## 2. Use the "cd" command to change your directory to inside of the cloned repository
`cd CS463-Course-Project/`

`make`
